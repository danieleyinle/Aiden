# AIDEN
**AI-Driven Emergency & Detection Network**

## Overview
**AIDEN** is a real-time community safety and risk awareness platform designed to help Nigerians detect, avoid, and respond to security threats before they turn deadly. 

Inspired by real incidents across the country, AIDEN helps people stay informed, make safer decisions, and avoid danger through verified alerts and community reportin.

Unlike traditional news outlets, AIDEN is a live safety network. It transforms scattered human reports into a unified, evolving "Dynamic Risk Landscape," allowing citizens to visualize danger zones and receive proximity alerts tailored to their location.


## Problem
Nigeria faces a security crisis where banditry, kidnappings, and targeted attacks occur with little warning. 
* **Delayed Info:** Most safety news surfaces after the damage is done.
* **No Unified Platform:** Communities rely on unverified social media or word-of-mouth.
* **Reactive Response:** Security responses are often too late because there is no early-warning data.


## Solution
AIDEN enables users to:
- Report security incidents in real time
- View verified danger zones on a live map
- Receive location-based safety alerts
- Stay informed before traveling or commuting
