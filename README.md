# AIDEN
**AI-Driven Emergency & Detection Network**

## Overview
AIDEN is a community-first safety and early-warning platform built in response
to rising insecurity in Nigeria, including banditry, kidnappings, and targeted
attacks on vulnerable communities.

Inspired by real incidents across the country, AIDEN helps people stay informed,
make safer decisions, and avoid danger through verified alerts and community
reporting.
